# If you don't want to blacklist any materials, use "  - NONE" instead.

# List of whitelisted materials. Materials on this list can be animated even if they're blacklisted

# Use the same list of materials as for the power blocks. For example, you would whitelist a bell like so:
#   - BELL
materialWhitelist: 
  - NONE


# List of materials that can be destroyed by opening a door.
# Normally, when a door encounters another block in the way, it will not toggle to avoid destroying that block
# However, when the material of that block is on this list, BigDoors will ignore the block and just overwrite it.
# This is mostly intended to avoid issues with toggling doors in snowy areas.
