### Shulker Options

# Make the player move with the shulker, this only has an effect when the shulker and player clip into one another.
# It will not have an effect when the shulker and player are not clipped into each other
# Potential tps impact on larger player and door counts
move-player-with-shulker: true

# Make all non-player entities move with the shulker, this only has an effect when the shulker and entity clip into one another.
# It will not have an effect when the shulker and entity are not clipped into each other
# Larger performance impact than with players, due to the usually larger amount of entities on a server
move-entity-with-shulker: true

# Verify that the moved entity is not clipping into the door when it finishes moving
# If a entity is standing on top of a door when it finishes moving they will be
# teleported up a small amount to prevent them from falling through the door
# This will only apply to entities / players if they are enabled above
# This should have a minimal performance impact
correct-ending-clipping: true

# Hide shulkers that are far away from the player
# NOTE: This requires ProtocolLib to work
cull-distant-shulkers: true

# How many blocks away a shulker needs to be to be culled
# Set to number less than 0 to always cull shulkers
# NOTE: If player interacts will culled shulker it will behave similarly to a ghost block
shulker-cull-distance: 4

# If shulkers should be spawned on the door, or far away
# When this is set to true the shulkers will be spawned near their final locations
# When this is set to false the shulkers will be spawned ~100k blocks above the world height to hide them while they are being set up
# Enabling this can help with compatibility with region plugins (Specifically if you are using regions to control mob spawning)
# By default this is enabled if ProtocolLib is on the server and shulkers will instead be hidden during setup using packets
spawn-shulkers-on-door: false

# Only change this setting if you are having issues with players being stuck inside of shulkers that are *not* moving upwards!
# This changes the extra distance that BDP will move a player upwards when they are detected to have sunken into a moving shulker
# This *may* help players who have poor ping.
# A reasonable value to begin testing at should be 0.1 rather than the default 0.05, however the optimal number will be different for every server.
player-sunken-into-shulker-y-extra: 0.05

### Barrier Options

# Use extra packets to hide barriers when they are far away
# This may have a medium performance impact, primarily fps
hide-barriers: true

# Move players who are near the door in accordance with the direction of the door
# This may have a small performance impact, primarily tps
move-player-with-barrier: true

### Other Options

# Whether or not to check for updates via https://modrinth.com/
# Updates will only be checked for on startup
